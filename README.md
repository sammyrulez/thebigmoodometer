The Big Mood-O-Meter
====================


I will demonstrate the real-time realization of a "sentiment-analysis" linguistic analyzer and, quickly, how to use it as a categorizer of comments on Reddit. The comments on the social network in 2017 and Spark (with Scala code) will be used as the initial set to implement the a classifier. The predictive approach and data source could allow us to create a tool to measure the general mood of Reddit users, the most positive and most negative groups, and perhaps something we still do not know.
